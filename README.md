# Iris Flower Classification

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*7bnLKsChXq94QjtAiRn40w.png">

Python programming and machine learning are combined in this project.
It focuses on using Scikit-Learn and machine learning techniques to classify IRIS flowers. 
Here, a variety of machine learning algorithms are used, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
To forecast and achieve accuracy, the following algorithms are employed:

1. Classifier based on decision trees 
2. The K nearest classifier
3. SVM
4. The Model of Logistic Regression 
5. Measuring
6. split_train_test
We use the Iris Dataset in the Iris project to produce accurate predictions.
This is straightforward and predictable for people who are unfamiliar with machine learning.

PS: Remember to give it a star if you like it!
